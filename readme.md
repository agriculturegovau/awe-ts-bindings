To regenerate,

npx openapi-typescript openapi.yaml --output intelligenice-api.ts

Once this is a bit more useful, maybe it should be on npm?

Also, should this be driven by github actions?

IE: instead of actually storing it, you hit "release" on github, and it packages up all the docs and pushes to npm...
